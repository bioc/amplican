Title: fast and precise analysis of CRISPR experiments
Description: `amplican` creates reports of deletions, insertions, frameshifts,
    cut rates and other metrics in user selected format (preferred HTML).
    `amplican` aligns your fastq samples and automates
    analysis across different experiments. `amplican` maintains elasticity
    through configuration file, which with your fastq samples are only
    requirements.
