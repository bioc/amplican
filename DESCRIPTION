Title: fast and precise analysis of CRISPR experiments
Description: Amplican creates raport of deletions, insertions, frameshifts,
    cut rates and other metrics in user selected format (interactive html, pdf).
    Amplican uses vary fast C implementation of Gotoh alhoritm to align your fastq
    samples and automates analysis across different experiments. Amplican maintains
    elasticity through configuration file, which with your fastq samples are only
    requirements.
