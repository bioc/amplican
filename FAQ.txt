This document covers frequent questions and verbose explanations for errors.

Q: I'm getting this error in the alignment process, "error: call of overloaded
   ‘to_string(const unsigned int&)’ is ambiguous"  , what shall I do?

A: Update your gcc compiler. Do "gcc -v" in your terminal. If you get
   something lower than this: "gcc version 4.7.2" then you will have troubles
   casting to strings. Once updated, try to run the funtion again. Or, you can
   also try to compile it. Use these commands in the terminal, being "%f" the
   file you want to compile and "%e" the name of the executable you want to
   create. Or just input that in your IDLE and it should take care of that for
   you:

   g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -c "%f"
   g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -o "%e" "%f"

   In here, you can read more about the changes done when it comes to string
   casting and its resolution:
