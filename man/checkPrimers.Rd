\title{This function check if the forward anr reverse primer is in the amplicon.}
\usage{
checkPrimers(forwardPrimer, reversePrimerReverseComplementary, amplicon, ID,
  barcode, configFilePath, logFileConn)
}
\arguments{
\item{string}{forwardPrimer: A sequence of nucleotides in a string format representing the forward primer}

\item{reversePrimer:}{A sequence of nucleotides in a string format representing the reverse primer. Usually
you want to reverse complement this BEFORE giving it to the function. The function WILL NOT
reverse complement it for you. (see: /libraries/tools.R , you have there the reverse
complement function)}

\item{amplicon:}{A sequence of nucleotides in a string format representing the amplicon}

\item{ID:}{The ID from where this target and amplicon came.}

\item{barcode:}{The barcode from where this target and amplicon came.}

\item{configFilePath:}{The location on disk where you can find the config file with this ID and barcode.

  file descriptor logFileConn: A file descriptor in R which is pointing to the log file.}
}
\value{
bool , TRUE:  Everything went good.
         FALSE: If the test fails and a warning is annotated.
}
\description{
The forward primer should be the one coming from the configuration file, while the reverse primer should be
reverse and complement. This function DOES NOT reverse complement the input. So if you look up for something
that is suppose to containt a reverse complement it won't find it. However you can use it to find any pair of
primers regarless if they are reverse complemented or not.
