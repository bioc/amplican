\title{Check which events overlap expected cut sites.}
\usage{
amplicanOverlap(aln, cfgT, cut_buffer = 5, relative = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{aln}{(data.frame) Contains relevant events in GRanges style.}

\item{cfgT}{(data.frame) Contains amplicon sequences.}

\item{cut_buffer}{(numeric) Number of bases that should expand 5' and 3' of
the specified expected cut sites.}

\item{relative}{(boolean) Default is TRUE, which means 'aln' events are
relative to thir cut sites, and most LEFT upper case letter specifies
position zero.}
}
\value{
(bolean vector) Where TRUE means that given event overlaps cut site.
}
\description{
To determine which deletions, insertions and mismatches (events) are probably
created by CRISPR we check whether they overlap expected cut sites. Expected
cut sites should be specified in UPPER CASE letters in the amplicon
sequences.
