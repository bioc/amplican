\title{Summarize how many reads have frameshift and how many reads have deletions.}
\usage{
amplicanSummarize(aln, cfgT)
}
\arguments{
\item{aln}{(data.frame) Contains events from the alignments.}

\item{cfgT}{(data.frame) Config file with the experiments details.}
}
\value{
(data.frame) As cfgT, but with extra columns.
}
\description{
Before using this function make sure events are filtered to represent
consensus with \code{amplicanConsensus}, if you use both forward and
reverse reads. If you want to calculate metrics over expected cut site,
filter events using \code{amplicanOverlap}.
}
\details{
Adds columns to cfgT:
\itemize{
\item{ReadsCut}{ Count of reads with deletions overlapping expected
cut site.}
\item{Reads_Frameshifted}{ Count of reads with frameshift
overlapping expected cut site.}
}
}
\examples{
file_path <- system.file("extdata", "results", "alignments",

aln <- data.table::fread(file_path)
