\usage{
makeAlignment(cfgT, average_quality, min_quality, scoring_matrix, gap_opening,
  gap_extension, fastqfiles, primer_mismatch)
}
\arguments{
\item{cfgT}{config file as data table}

\item{average_quality}{(numeric) The FASTQ file have a quality for each
nucleotide, depending on sequencing technology there exist many formats.
This package uses \code{\link[ShortRead]{readFastq}} to parse the reads.
If the average quality of the reads fall below value of
\code{average_quality} then sequence is filtered. Default is 0.}

\item{min_quality}{(numeric)  Similar as in average_quality, but depicts
the minimum quality for ALL nucleotides in given read. If one of nucleotides
has quality BELLOW \code{min_quality}, then the sequence is filtered.
Default is 20.}

\item{scoring_matrix}{(matrix) Default is 'NUC44'. Pass desired matrix using
\code{\link[Biostrings]{nucleotideSubstitutionMatrix}}.}

\item{gap_opening}{(numeric) The opening gap score.}

\item{gap_extension}{(numeric) The gap extension score.}

\item{fastqfiles}{(numeric) Normally you want to use both FASTQ files. But in
some special cases, you may want to use only the forward file, or only
the reverse file. Possible options:
\itemize{
 \item{0}{ Use both FASTQ files.}
 \item{0.5}{ Use both FASTQ files, but only for one of the reads (forward or
 reverse) is required to have primer perfectly matched to sequence - eg. use
 when reverse reads are trimmed of primers, but forward reads have forward
 primer in the sequence.}
 \item{1}{ Use only the forward FASTQ file.}
 \item{2}{ Use only the reverse FASTQ file.}
}}

\item{primer_mismatch}{(numeric) Decide how many mismatches are allowed
during primer matching of the reads, that groups reads by experiments.
When \code{primer_mismatch = 0} no mismatches are allowed, which can increase
number of unasssigned read.}

\description{
Aligning reads to the amplicons for each ID in this barcode, constructing
amplicanAlignment. Assume that all IDs here belong to the same barcode.
