# amplican: R package for the analysis of CRISPR induced mutations using sequencing amplicon data

#### This package is still under development, although this version is stable and can be used already.

#### About

Our R packageâ€™s main function performs alignment of the amplicon reads, calculates multiple statistics (eg. cut rates, frameshifts) and presents results in form of HTML pages. Whole analysis starting from fastq files, ending with HTML reports is compacted to one simple function. Each report contains plots and tables in high quality format, that can be immediately further used by users. We provide a wide range of reports that allow breakdown of experiments by different constraints. We support experiment, barcode, group/user defined, guide and amplicon as possible levels of statistics aggregation.

#### Installation

Package is available on Bioconductor. It is possible to install from here, but it requires installation of many dependencies and is not recomended.

```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("amplican")
```  

#### More information

After installation run:
```r
library(amplican)

# main functions
?amplican
?amplicanPipeline
?amplicanAlign
?amplicanReport
?plot_cuts
?metaplot_deletions
